    <p><b>2023/01/27: Houston, the Blog Has Landed!</b></p>
    <p>
      Welcome to the relaunch of my personal website! Things are a bit bare
      currently (both stylistically and contentwise), but eventually I intend
      both to get my old blog posts up here as well as various new excursions
      into the written word.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who don't know me, hi! My name's Otto! I am an artist, musician,
      writer, online socialite, and aspiring full-stack web developer. I have
      and will continue to wear many hats because that is simply what intrigues
      me, and it's honestly fitting in the modern era, where this seems to be
      somewhat expected of us as a general rule. I have a particular fixation
      with media and pop culture of all kinds, so it is likely that much of my
      output, as far as it concerns blogging, will center on these things, but
      it's also hard to make any sweeping proclamation about the future, so
      maybe it will come to pass that this space will develop into something
      entirely different from my initial assumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the case, it seems futile to try to define it now, so we'll just
      appreciate it as a space that is hopefully, for better or worse, always
      unapologetically "me". I also hope to simply try harder than I have in
      past attempts at throwing up a blog. I want this to be the kind of place
      that I can feel proud of linking to people. My writing skills have always
      been decent, but for whatever reason, I have never truly felt proud of any
      of my output in that arena. This blog should ideally represent a line
      drawn in the sand, any steps beyond which I hope are more fruitful than
      they have been in the past.
